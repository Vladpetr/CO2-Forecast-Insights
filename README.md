# CO2-Forecast-Insights
Explores and forecasts future atmospheric CO₂ levels using advanced statistical modeling to gain valuable insights into climate change dynamics and high-risk CO₂ thresholds.

## Project Overview
In this project, I created a statistical model that explains the Mauna Loa Observatory's weekly atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) measurements since 1958 and use it to forecast CO₂ levels up to the start of 2060. The goal is to reflect uncertainty in the predictions, demonstrating confidence intervals that widen as we project further into the future. Additionally, I utilized the model to predict when the world is likely to reach high-risk levels of CO₂, which could lead to serious climate change.

## Data
To conduct the analysis, I took the dataset of the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, providing direct data on atmospheric CO₂ levels.

## Model Implementation
The following tasks were completed:
* [x] Examined the baseline model and identified its flaws. Suggested improvements and modifications to create a more accurate and robust model for forecasting CO₂ levels.
* [x] Performed inference on the refined model using PyStan. 
* [x] Using the inferred model, forecasted atmospheric CO₂ levels at Mauna Loa for the next 40 years, up to the start of 2060. Confidence intervals were generated to reflect the uncertainty in predictions.
